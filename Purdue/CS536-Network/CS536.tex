\subsection{Components of a computer network}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item host devices (PC, server, laptop)
    \item routers \& switches (IP router, Ethernet switches, WiFi routers)
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The global internet has 2 types of routing going on: 1. \textbf{Intranet}: routing within a domain. 2. \textbf{Internet}: routing between domains.
        \end{itemize}
    \item links (wires, fiber, quantum)
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Confidentiality. We need to encrypt the data.
            \item Authentication. We need to make sure the data is from the right source.
            \item Integrity. We need to make sure the data is not modified.
            \item Bounded by the speed of light. For wireless or wired today, we use eletromagnetic waves.
            FDM (Frequency Division Multiplexing) $\rightarrow$ OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing)
        \end{itemize}
    \item protocals (IP, TCP, UDP, ...). All protocals are part of an OS (in kernel mode). Protocal helps connect different parts of the network. Examples from low- to high-layer:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item NIC: Network Interface Card. Such as Ethernet card, WALN card, etc. It is read only memory code. \textbf{Lower half of the OS}.
            \item Device Drivers. \textbf{Lower half of the OS}.
            \item ARP, RARP. \textbf{OS}.
            \item IP. \textbf{OS}.
            \item OSPF, RIP, BGP. OFPF, RIP: within organizations (intra-domain). BGP: global Internet (inter-domain). \textbf{OS}.
            \item TCP, UDP. \textbf{OS}.
            \item DNS, HTTP, SMTP, SNMP, SSL. \textbf{Application}.
            \item SSH, web browser, PHP, P2P, YouTube etc. \textbf{Application}.
        \end{itemize}
    \item applications (DNS, HTTP, SMTP, SSL, ...)
    \item humans and bots (spam, DoS, worm, ...)
\end{enumerate}

\begin{info}
    1, 2 and 3 are \textbf{hardware}, 4 and 5 are \textbf{software}.
\end{info}

\subsection{Communication}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item Types of information transmition: \textbf{analog} and \textbf{digital}.
    \item In today's networks, the content is digital (bits), but the transmission is analog (eletromagnetic waves) $\rightarrow$ use analog information to transmit digital information.
\end{itemize}

Capability of network and end systems:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item information aabstraction:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item digital content representatoin: encode/decode information.
            \item analog rerpesentation and transmission of digital content: analog signals over physical media.
        \end{itemize}
    \item information protection:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item deal with infornation corruption (bits flip). Use BER (Bit Error Rate) to measure the quality of the link.
            \item deal with information loss(packet drop at routers and hosts). e.g., culprit: buffer overflow.
            \item security. e.g., confidentiality, authentication, integrity, protect from infrustracture attacks such as DoS.
        \end{itemize}
    \item performance:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item fast transmission: throughputs (bps), bottleneck can be software. 
            
            Why 1Gbps Ethernet is not 1Gbps throughputs? TCP is not one-time transmission. TCP is a \textbf{reliable} protocal, which means it will make sure the data is delivered. TCP will send a packet, wait for the ACK, and then send the next packet.

            \item information latency: physical distance, buffering of messages at routers and hosts. Bad for real-time applications such as video streaming, online gaming, etc.
        \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Types of networks}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item connectivity:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item point-to-point
            \item multi-access (broadcast)
            \item internetwork (network of networks such as Purdue's campus network)
        \end{itemize}
    \item medium:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item wired
            \item wireless
        \end{itemize}
    \item locaiton:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item stationary
            \item mobile
        \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Point-to-point link}
\imgc{p2p.png}{Point-to-point link}{0.5}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item NIC at A, NIC at B
    \item A and B don't need names in principle.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Multi-access link}
\imgc{multi-access.png}{Multi-access link}{0.5}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item sometimes called bus
    \item names (i.e., addressing) necessary, called local area network (LAN) addresses.
    \item key issue of multi-access link communication: access
    control.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item link is a shared resource.
            \item myriad of LAN technologies and protocols.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}  

\subsubsection{Internetwork}
\imgc{internetwork.png}{Internetwork}{0.5}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item recursive definition: network of networks.
    \item everything is the composition of point-to-point links and multi-access links.
    \item additional complications:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item new names beyond LAN addresses: in principle, LAN addresses are unique and suffice.In practice, new names (i.e., network addresses) bring benefits despite overhead. 
            \item protocol translation: LANs speak different languages (e.g., Ethernet and
            WLAN)
            \item location management: mobility. e.g., handoff of mobile host among multiple networks.
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
